# how to install packages

You only need to install a package once on your machine. Once the package is installed, you will need to use `library()` to load the functions in it every time you want to use it, but the installation is a one time job. So you can either do it in the console, or using the packages tab.

## option 1

Install a package by typing the following command with the name of the package you would like to install in the console.

```         
install.packages("packagename")
```

## option 2

Alternatively, search for the package you would like to install in the packages tab.

![You can search for packages and install them from CRAN via the packages tab](images/install.png)

> Remember once you have installed a package, you will need to use the `library()` function to load it before it will work.
