    "text": "Welcome\nThis book is written in mind for someone working in Psychology and is venturing into R with little to no experience. Research data in Psychology is unique in that it is collected in formats that are human-readable but not exactly R-readable. Data wrangling conventions will often vary depending on research question and therefore by which data is collected. In “R for Psychology”, we have compiled a series of real-world examples from different sub-disciplines and will walk through the process of wrangling, summary, analyses and visualisations\n\n\n\n\nHow to contribute\nThis book is built using Quarto and hosted via GitHub Pages. It is a living resource, we welcome any contributions from the Psychology community that would improve the quality of this book. There are many ways to contribute:\n\nFixing grammar and typos\nClarification or expanding on existing content\nContribute real-world data in worked examples\nAuthoring an entire chapter\n\nTake a look at our Contributing Guide to see how you can help!\n\n\nAcknowledgements\nThis book was created on the unceded territory of the Bedegal people who are the Traditional custodians of the lands where the Kensington campus is located.\nThe first version of this book was funded by the UNSW Research Infrastructure Scheme.\nWe would like to thank the following people who have contributed to the book:\n@daxkellie"
