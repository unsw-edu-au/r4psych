    "text": "Welcome\nThe book is written in mind for someone working in Psychology and is venturing into R with little to no experience. Research data in Psychology is unique in that it is collected in formats that are human-readable but not exactly R-readable. Data wrangling conventions will often vary depending on research question and therefore by which data is collected. In “R for Psychology”, we have compiled a series of real-world examples from different sub-disciplines and will walk through the process of wrangling, summary, analyses and visualisations\n\nHow to contribute\n\n\nAcknowledgements"
