    "text": "Welcome!\nThis book is written in mind for someone working in Psychology and is venturing into R with little to no experience. Research data in Psychology is unique in that it is collected in formats that are human-readable but not exactly R-readable. Data wrangling conventions will often vary depending on research question and therefore by what type data is collected. In “R for Psychology”, we have compiled a series of real-world examples from different sub-disciplines and will walk through the process of wrangling, summary, analyses and visualisations\nThis book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License.\n\n\n\nHow to contribute\nThis book is built using Quarto and hosted via GitHub Pages. It is a living resource, we welcome any contributions from the Psychology community that would improve the quality of this book. There are many ways to contribute:\n\nFixing grammar and typos\nClarification or expanding on existing content\nContribute real-world data in worked examples\nAuthoring an entire chapter\n\nTake a look at our Contributing Guide to see how you can help!\n\n\nAcknowledgements\nThis book was created on the unceded territory of the Bedegal people who are the Traditional custodians of the lands where the Kensington campus is located.\nThe first version of this book was funded by the UNSW Research Infrastructure Scheme.\nWe would like to thank the following people who have contributed to the book:\n@daxkellie"

Humans have gotten out of the habit of thinking very hard about where they put things on their machine - the search capabilities on the modern computer are quite good and you can generally find files quite easily by searching for them.\nWhen you are coding in R, however, you need to explicitly tell R where to find things. You can make this process much easier for yourself by always working within an RStudio Project.\nWhen you work within an RStudio project, you can reference everything in relation to the top level of that project folder. It doesn’t matter where that project folder lives on your machine (i.e. Desktop, Documents, OneDrive, Dropbox) the code you write is always relative to that folder. This means that you share that whole project folder with someone else (your collaborators or supervisor), and your code won’t break.\n\nWhen you start a new analysis project, create a New RStudio Project via the File tab.\n\n\n\n\nWorking in an RStudio Project\n\n\nAlways open RStudio by double clicking on the .RProj file in the folder on your machine. There is an icon in the top right corner of RStudio IDE that shows you which project you are working in and makes it easy to switch between projects."

In all likelihood, when you come back to this analysis in a few months time, you will have no recollection how it actually worked, but you can leave yourself some breadcrumbs by being a bit intentional about naming things.\nYour file names should be meaningful and orderly. The name of the file should tell the new user (or future you) what is in the file and where it goes in the process.\n\ncleaning-functions.R\n1_wrangle.Rmd\n2_visualise.Rmd\n3_analyse.Rmd\n\nIn this project, I can tell by glancing at the file names that I have a script (.R) that contains functions and three R Markdown files that contain each stage of the analysis.\nSticking with lower case is a good idea; avoid special characters and use - or _ to fill any gaps.\nFind more useful naming tips in the Tidyverse Style guide."

For this reason, we recommend using R Markdown documents (rather than R scripts) for your analysis.\nR Markdown is a handy file format that allows you to intersperse chunks of code with notes. This kind of document makes it easy to writing explanations, interpretations, thoughts for your future self as you code. This kind of documentation makes it much more likely to be able to make sense of what you have done and why, when you come back to your analysis in a few months time.\nR Markdown documents can also be “knitted” into html, pdf, or word documents, allowing you to share your analysis (and associated thoughts) with collaborators, even if they don’t know R.\nFor a quick get up to speed on R Markdown and how to use it, check out RLadiesSydney #RYouWithMe MarkyMark module"
