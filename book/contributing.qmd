# Contributing 

This resource is created in mind so that the community that uses it, can also contribute to it. We hope this mindset will encourage the resource to grow and stay up-to-date for R learners. 

Importantly, **all skill levels** are welcome to contribute, even if you think your skills are not up to scratch - this is what this guide is for! 

### GitHub Workflow

Let’s talk about the Git/GitHub part of the workflow. Git is a **version control** system. It that **tracks changes in our code** that generated this book and helps us **coordinate our collaborative edits**. 

Git monitors the changes in a project directory a.k.a **repository** or "repo". There are two types of repositories: 

- **Local** repository: This is a project directory that exists _locally_ in your computer than git is actively watching over. 

- **Remote** repository: This is a **synced** copy of your local repo. The [remote repo](https://github.com/unsw-edu-au/r4psych) for this book lives on GitHub. GitHub **centralises** our collaborative efforts. It provides a platform for the community to make a local copy of the book, create changes and introduce them back to the remote repository. GitHub also acts as the hosting service for the book itself which is also a big bonus for us. 

#### Sign up to GitHub

Start by getting yourself an account at GitHub [by signing up here](https://github.com/signup)


#### Install git

Now, follow [these instructions](https://happygitwithr.com/install-git) from "Happy Git with R"  to install git to your computer. 


#### Make a local copy

First let's get you started by getti




We will work in branches so as to not overwrite each other’s work, and let GitHub do what it does best.

The main branch will be the current approved version of the book. The main branch is what displays at https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/earthdata-cloud-cookbook.

A nice clean workflow with branches is to consider them temporary. You pull the most recent from main, you create a branch locally, you make your edits, you commit regularly, you push regularly to github.com, and then you create a pull request for it to be merged into main, and when it’s approved the branch is deleted on github.com and you also delete it locally. That’s the workflow we’ll walk through here. A great resource on GitHub setup and collaboration is Happy Git with R, which includes fantastic background philosophy as well as bash commands for setup, workflows, and collaboration.

The following assumes you’ve completed the initial setup from the previous chapter.
