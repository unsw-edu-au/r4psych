# Introduction

## What you will learn

How to: 

- **Read** your hard-earned data into R 
- **Wrangle and clean** the data in a R-friendly format
- **Produce** summary statistics
- **Analyse** your data
- **Visualise** your findings

<!-- Some simply, yet profound conceptual diagram that shows the reader all these processes -->

## How book is organised 

This book is organised by data type (e.g. [Survey data](survery.qmd), Questionnaire data). 

Each chapter will walk through the process will work with real-world Psychology data and will walk you through  reading in data, to cleaning and eventually analysis and visualising the results. 

### Conventions

We will refer to packages as `{dplyr}` and functions as `mean()` and variables and objects (such as file names or data objects) as `age` and `mtcars`. Where it would aid understanding, we will sometimes refer to functions within a particular packages as `dplyr::mutuate()`

### Version control with git

### R packages

Every code section will always begin with calls to R packages. There will be commented out code for you to install these. 

Here are few packages we consider essential to working with Psychology data. 

- tidyverse 
- ggplot2
- here
- janitor

At the end of each chapter, we will also include our call to `sessionInfo()` so you can see what version of which packages we are using. 

## Virtual environments

Speaking on what package versions we are using as we write this book, we understand the R package space is constantly changing. This means sometimes code will break due to package updates and this is all part of the process! To combat this problem, we've enlisted [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html#getting-started) to create a reproducible environment for building this book. 

### Download our virtual environment

The virtual environment used to build this book is stored in a `lockfile`. You can find this file in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/unsw-edu-au/r4psych) where the source code of this book lives. 

The lockfile is named `renv.lock`. You can download this file directly but clicking on the file name and clicking on the "Download raw file" button.

Alternatively, you can [clone](https://happygitwithr.com/clone.html?q=clone#clone) our repository into your computer. Learn more about cloning repositorsies and other GitHub workflows in [Happy Git](https://happygitwithr.com/) by Jenny Bryan. 

Once you have this file downloaded, move it in a relevant [project directory]() and then we can let `{renv}` work its magic. 

### Install

First things first, lets install `renv` if we don't have it already. 

```{r, eval}
install.packages("renv")

library(renv)
```
### Recreate virtual enviroment

Now let's tell `renv` where our downloaded `renv.lock` file is. Specific the path to the file in the function `restore()` and you are good to go!

```{r, eval=FALSE}
restore(lockfile = "path_to_renv.lock")
```
