    "text": "Welcome!\nThis book is written in mind for someone working in Psychology and is venturing into R with little to no experience. Research data in Psychology is unique in that it is collected in formats that are human-readable but not exactly R-readable. Data wrangling conventions will often vary depending on research question and therefore by what type data is collected. In ‚ÄúR for Psychology‚Äù, we have compiled a series of real-world examples from different sub-disciplines and will walk through the process of wrangling, summary, analyses and visualisations\nThis book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License.\n\n\n\nHow to contribute\nThis book is built using Quarto and hosted via GitHub Pages. It is a living resource, we welcome any contributions from the Psychology community that would improve the quality of this book. There are many ways to contribute:\n\nFixing grammar and typos\nClarification or expanding on existing content\nContribute real-world data in worked examples\nAuthoring an entire chapter\n\nTake a look at our Contributing Guide to see how you can help!\n\n\nAcknowledgements\nThis book was created on the unceded territory of the Bedegal people who are the Traditional custodians of the lands where the Kensington campus is located.\nThe first version of this book was funded by the UNSW Research Infrastructure Scheme.\nWe would like to thank the following people who have contributed to the book:\n@daxkellie",

Humans have gotten out of the habit of thinking very hard about where they put things on their machine; the search capabilities on the modern computer are quite good and you can generally find files quite easily by searching for them.\nWhen you are coding in R, however, you need to explicitly tell R where to find things. You can make this process much easier for yourself by always working within an RStudio Project.\nWhen you work within an RStudio project, you can reference everything in relation to the top level of that project folder. It doesn‚Äôt matter where that project folder lives on your machine (i.e.¬†Desktop, Documents, OneDrive, Dropbox) the code you write is always relative to your project folder. This means that you can share that whole project folder with someone else (your collaborators or supervisor), and your code won‚Äôt break.\nAlways open RStudio by double clicking on the .RProj file in the folder on your machine.

For this reason, we recommend using R Markdown documents (rather than R scripts) for your analysis.\nR Markdown is a handy file format that allows you to intersperse chunks of code with notes. This kind of document makes it easy to write explanations, interpretations, and thoughts for your future self as you code. This kind of documentation makes it much more likely to be able to make sense of what you have done and why, when you come back to your analysis in a few months time.\nR Markdown documents can also be ‚Äúknitted‚Äù into html, pdf, or word documents, allowing you to share your analysis (and associated thoughts) with collaborators, even if they don‚Äôt know R.\nTo get up to speed on R Markdown and how to use it, check out RLadiesSydney #RYouWithMe MarkyMark module",

    "text": "8.0.1 Getting access\nFirst, let‚Äôs make sure you have collaborator access to the repository.\n\nHead over to your repository settings\nIf you see unsw-edu-au and the repo name: unsw-edu-au/r4psych in the list then you have collaborator access to the repository.\n\n\nIf you don‚Äôt, let‚Äôs go through how you can request an invite to be a collaborator\n\n8.0.1.1 Request access\nCreate an issue requesting for collaborator access and one of the maintainers with admin rights will send through an invite.\n\n\n\n8.0.2 The set up\nThe set up for maintainer‚Äôs is the same for contributors. Check out the following sections to get started:\n\nInstall Quarto\nGitHub Workflow\n\n\n\n8.0.3 The Maintainer‚Äôs workflow\nThe maintainer‚Äôs workflow goes like this:\n\nYou clone the remote repo\nYou create a new feature branch.\nYou work on your branch and make your edits, you commit regularly, you push regularly to the remote.\nWhen you are happy with your changes, you will create a pull request for your contribution and one of the other maintainers will review it. Edits may be requested or one of the maintainers will make the changes after having a conversation with you.\nOnce everything and everyone is happy and dandy with the final changes, your changes will be approved and merged into main. When this happens, your branch is deleted on the remote and you will also delete it locally.\n\nThis workflow treats branches as temporary entities and will keeps the remote tidy and streamlined.\nNow let‚Äôs walk through this workflow step by step.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe next sections assumes you‚Äôve completed the initial set-up of installing git and a git client. We will focus on using Github Desktop, but the main git commands should translate to whichever client you are using.\n\n\n\n\n8.0.4 Clone: Create a local copy of the book\nNow that we have all the installation/setup out of the way, we can get started!\nLets get you a local copy of the book onto your computer by ‚Äúcloning‚Äù the repository\nHead over to the remote repo for the book:\n\nClick on the big green button that says Code\n\n\nHere you will find a drop-down menu showing different methods of cloning the code from the remote repo.\nWe will stick with the default option of using HTTPS a.k.a. cloning by using the URL of the remote repo.\n\nClick on the copy URL button (The stacked squares icon)\nNavigate to Github Desktop and click on the first drop down menu from the left. Here you will find the Add button.\n\n\n\nClick on Add and then Clone Repository\nClick on the URL option and paste in the URL of this book‚Äôs remote repo e.g.¬†https://github.com/unsw-edu-au/r4psych\nUnder Local Path, you can choose where you want to place this cloned repo. Avoid putting your repos in Cloud services such as Dropbox or Google Drive. These can sometimes interfere with git‚Äôs ability to track your changes.\nFinally, click Clone and let git do the work! It will copy everything that is in the remote repo and bring it down locally on your computer!\nNavigate to the local path where you told git to clone to in Step 7 and check out the directories. You will learn more about these in Book Structure\n\n\n\n8.0.5 Branches: Create your own working copy\nAs maintainers, we will work on branches which are internal copies of the book. This is so we overwrite each other‚Äôs work. This approach will also allow us to have a systematic way in introducing new content to the book. Coordinating collaborative changes on the same project is what GitHub does best.\nThe main branch is currently the most recent approved version of the book - this is displayed at https://unsw-edu-au.github.io/r4psych/\nWhen you clone a repository, the main branch is selected by default.\nTo create your own branch:\n\nClick on the middle menu that says ‚ÄúCurrent branch main‚Äù\nClick on ‚ÄúNew Branch‚Äù\n\n\n\nGive your branch a name.\n\nKeep it concise and related to the feature you are going to work on e.g restructure-wrangle. Separate words with a hyphen.\nAt the end of your branch name, put down your initials, that way other maintainers know who is working on which branch. e.g restructure-wrangle-fk\n\nClick on ‚ÄúCreate Branch‚Äù and voila! Git will automatically switch from main to your branch for you.\n\nAt this stage, your branch exists locally on your computer, no where else.\n\nNext, we will click on ‚ÄúPublish branch‚Äù, this will make your branch available on the remote repo so we can formally incorporate its changes to the main once your edits are done. Publishing your branch also allows other maintainer‚Äôs see your progress.\n\n\n\n8.0.6 Make your changes\nNow that you have our own internal copy of the book, you can freely make changes pertaining to the feature you want to work on.\nNavigate to the local repo and click on the r4pysch.Rproj file. This will open up the project in RStudio.\nYou can also use the buttons in Github Desktop to quickly navigate to the project files.\n\n\n8.0.6.1 Commit: A save point for your work\nNow let‚Äôs make a change to a chapter.\n\nAs a proof of concept, let‚Äôs add a comment in the Wrangle chapter.\n\n\n\nSave this change and have a look at Github Desktop. Notice how git has detected your change? Additions are flagged in green, any deletions are flagged in red. Cool right?!\n\nNow we are going to commit these changes. Think of committing your work as saving your progress in a video. A commit is a safe anchor point to come back to if you need.\n\nBy default, git will tick the check box for you. This check box process is technically called ‚Äústaging‚Äù. Its choosing the files you want git to track.\nNow include a meaningful, concise message that will be associated with your commit. These are usually summaries that pertains to the changes you‚Äôve made. In this case, ‚ÄúAdded comment to Wrangle chapter‚Äù will suffice.\nClick on the blue button Commit to restructure-wrangle and git will save your changes as a checkpoint.\n\nThere is not hard and fast rule with how often you should commit your work. Typically they are bite-sized amounts of work towards the feature you are working on. Thinking about commits as potential check points in time you want to come back to e.g.¬†just after some restructuring/rewording of a big section.\n\n\n8.0.6.2 Push: Sync your work with remote\nUp until this point, all your changes exist locally on your computer. No one else has these changes. Our last step to complete our git/Github workflow is to push our work to the remote repo so other it is available for others to review.\nTo push your work:\n\nClick on the blue button that says ‚ÄúPush origin‚Äù\n\nThis is sync your local changes with those on the remote. Once you‚Äôve done that, you can view your synced changes on the remote repo by selecting your feature branch name under the left dropdown menu\n\n\nAlternatively, you can click on the third tab menu also labelled as ‚ÄúPush origin‚Äù that has an up arrow ‚¨ÜÔ∏è\n\nContinue committing and pushing your work as you make your edits on your feature branch. Its generally good practice to push your work before you step away from working on the book. This is to ensure all your work is synced and shared on the remote.\n\n\n\n8.0.7 Pull Request: Submit your feature for review\nOnce you are happy with your edits on your feature branch and we will prepare a pull request so we can merge them into the main branch.\n\nWe will refer to pull requests as PR from now on\n\nThink of a pull request like code peer review. The idea is have another maintainer go over your eidts and provide any constructive feedback/edits. This process ensures that the contributions are vetted by the maintainers and merged in to the main branch systematically.\nThere are two ways to create a pull request:\n\n8.0.7.1 A. Open PR within GitHub Desktop\n\nAfter pushing your changes, Github Desktop will automatically prompt you to ‚ÄúPreview Pull Request‚Äù. Clicking on this blue button will open a window showing you some key details\n\n\n\nAt the top, it will tell you what which base branch you are merging into. By default it will be set to main. In the screenshot above, we can see that we are proposing to merge restructure-wrangle into base: main\nYou will see a preview of the changes you‚Äôve made to the book. Green are additions, red are deletions.\nAt the bottom, it will say whether your edits can be easily merged it or whether there are conflicts. We will talk about how to handle conflicts next.\n\nOnce you are happy with your preview, click on the blue botton to ‚ÄúCreate Pull Request‚Äù\n\nClicking this button will open a browser to the Github website.\n\n Here you see the same sort of information from the preview. You are prompted to write a short title and short summary for your PR. These will form the basis of your commit message when it‚Äôs approved.\n\nKeep your summary concise, use bullet points or hyperlinks if you find them helpful. You can refer to a Github Issue number using a # suffix. (More of this later).\nRequest one of the maintainers using the Reviewer dropdown menu to they can review your PR.\nOnce you are happy, click the green button ‚ÄúCreate Pull Request‚Äù\n\nTA-DA!!! üéâ You‚Äôre done!!! That is the entire git/Github workflow. Now leave this with the maintainer you‚Äôve tagged, they may request have some suggestions for you before the official approval but the hardest part is over!\n\n\n8.0.7.2 B: Open PR from Github Website\nYou can al\n\n\n8.0.7.3 If suggestions are requested\nYou will be prompted via email if there are comments or suggestions made to our PR. The conversations are documented via the PR tab on the Github website. Your feature branch is still active, you can continue making changes and commits to your feature and once they are pushed. They are show up in the PR you have created.\nBefore you launch into making actual edits to the book, let‚Äôs talk about how R packages are managed for this book. This is important since this is a book about using R and you will most definitely introduce packages in certain chapters. Its also important as the book gains more maintainers working across different computers.\n\n\n\n8.0.8 {renv}: Managing R packages\nWe use renv to manage the R packages that are used by the book across different R versions and operating systems. renv uses a package cache. That means you only ever have to download and install a package once, and for each subsequent install!\nLearn more from the renv website\nBriefly, renv monitors and installs any R packages that are used in a project. renv records this information so that anyone opening up this book will have access to the same R package versions:\nrenv stores information in several places:\n\nrenv/library/ directory\n\nHere you can see R packages for the different versions of R that was used during the creation of this book.\n\nrenv.lock\n\nThis is a lockfile and contains information about the R packages so that it can be re-installed on a new computer. The great thing about a lockfile is that you can share this which colleagues and they can use renv to reproduce the exact R package environment that was recorded.\n\n.Rprofile This is a project profile and it is run automatically every time you start R. renv uses it to configure your R session to use the project library in renv/library/.\n\n\n8.0.8.1 {renv} workflow\nWe are going to learn some new renv lingo so help us manage our R package environment.\n\n8.0.8.1.1 When you open up the project\nEach time you open this book project up run:\n\n\n- The library is already synchronized with the lockfile.\n\n\nThis will prompt renv to check and install any R packages that you may not have locally. If you have all the packages installed already, renv will tell you you‚Äôre synchronised.\n\n\n8.0.8.1.2 When you want to add R packages\nOver time, our book will need more packages. You can continue to use familiar tools like install.packages(). You can also use renv::install() it‚Äôs a little less typing and can install packages from GitHub, Bioconductor, and more, not just CRAN. Ta-da!\n\n\nThe following package(s) will be installed:\n- janitor [2.2.0]\nThese packages will be installed into \"~/work/r4psych/r4psych/renv/library/R-4.4/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu\".\n\n# Installing packages --------------------------------------------------------\n- Installing janitor ...                        OK [linked from cache]\nSuccessfully installed 1 package in 7.4 milliseconds.\n\n\nAfter installing the package and checking that your code works, you should call renv::snapshot() to record the latest package versions in your lockfile. You‚Äôll need to commit those changes to git and let your collaborators know that you‚Äôve updated the lockfile and they should call renv::restore() when they‚Äôre next working on a project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis is why its good practice to call renv::restore() each time you open the project üòÅ\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.0.9 Book Structure",

    "text": "This resource is created in mind so that the community that uses it, can also contribute to it. We hope this mindset will encourage the resource to grow and stay up-to-date for R learners.\nImportantly, all skill levels are welcome to contribute, even if you think your skills are not up to scratch - this is what this guide is for! There is also a way for you to contribute if code/git/Quarto is not your cup of tea.\n\n9.0.1 Hello Quarto!\nThis book is built by Quarto which is an open source, cross-language publishing system that allows users to build beautiful things from blogs, to websites and books!\nYou can learn more about the capabilities of Quarto in this talk by Mine √áetinkaya-Rundel & Julia Stewart Lowndes at posit::conf(2023)\n\n9.0.1.1 Install Quarto\nFirst things first, let‚Äôs make sure we have the latest version of Quarto installed using these instructions\n\n\n\n9.0.2 GitHub Workflow\nNext, we need to talk about the Git/GitHub part of the workflow. Git is a version control system. It that tracks changes in our code that generated this book and helps us coordinate our collaborative edits.\nGit monitors the changes in a project directory a.k.a repository or ‚Äúrepo‚Äù. There are two types of repositories:\n\nLocal repository: This is a project directory that exists locally in your computer than git is actively watching over.\nRemote repository: This is a synced copy of your local repo. The remote repo for this book lives on GitHub. GitHub centralises our collaborative efforts. It provides a platform for the community to make a local copy of the book, create changes and introduce them back to the remote repository. GitHub also acts as the hosting service for the book itself which is also a big bonus for us.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nA great resource on GitHub setup and collaboration is Happy Git with R, which includes fantastic background philosophy as well as tips for set-up, workflows, and collaboration.\n\n\n\n9.0.2.1 Sign up to GitHub\nStart by getting yourself an account at GitHub by signing up here\n\n\n9.0.2.2 Install git\nFollow these instructions from ‚ÄúHappy Git with R‚Äù to install git to your computer. There are specific instructions for different operating systems.\n\n\n9.0.2.3 Install a git client\nTraditionally, git has been used in the shell terminal. This is the ‚Äòback-end‚Äô of the computer and allows you to interact with your computer using code. This means that you have to type out commands to tell git what to do. This approach can become a little overwhelming when you are starting out.\nInstead, we suggest using a git client like Github Desktop, however it is limited to only to Windows and Mac. If you use Linux, GitKraken is also a great alternative. There are many git clients to choose from. Once you start to get the hang on things, all of these clients are much of the same and its a matter of personal preference.\nIf you are an RStudio user, there is a built-in git tab to the interface, its features are more simplified than the previously mentioned clients but does the basic commands that we will talk about next.\nOnce you have downloaded a client, follow it‚Äôs instructions to login and connect your Github account to the client.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFor the rest of the chapter, we will focus on using Github Desktop, but the main git commands should translate to whichever client you are using.\n\n\n\n\n\n9.0.3 The Contributor‚Äôs workflow\nWe will work on forks (independent copies of the book) so as to not overwrite each other‚Äôs work and have a systematic way in introducing new contributions to the book. Coordinating collaborative changes on the same project is what GitHub does best.\nThe main branch is currently the most recent approved version of the book - this is displayed at https://unsw-edu-au.github.io/r4psych/\nThe contributing workflow looks like this:\n\nYou fork the most recent version from main\nYou make your edits, you commit regularly, you push regularly to the remote (github.com)\nWhen you are happy with your changes, you will create a pull request for your contribution and one of the core maintainers will review it. Edits may be requested or one of the maintainers will make the changes after having a conversation with you.\nOnce everything and everyone is happy and dandy with the final changes, your changes will be approved and merged into main. When this happens, your branch is deleted on the remote and you will also delete it locally.\n\nNow let‚Äôs walk through this workflow step by step\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe following sections assumes you‚Äôve completed the initial set-up of installing git and a git client\n\n\n\n9.0.3.1 Fork: Create an independent copy of the book\nNow that we have all the installation out of the way, we can get started!\nThe best way to contribute to the book is to create an independent copy that lives in your Github account. This process is called creating a fork and it allows you to make your contributions without it affecting the approved version of the book.\n\nTo create a fork, head over to the remote repo for the book and click on the Fork button on the right hand side of the webpage\n\n\n\nContinue to the next webpage and leave the default settings as they are and click the green button Create fork\n\n\nForking will create a duplicate of the r4psych book remote repo into your account. This is your remote copy that you can make your contributions to. We will talk about how we bring your contributions back to the r4psych remote repo later in Create a pull request.\n\n\n9.0.3.2 Clone: Create a local copy of your fork\nOnce you have a fork, we will get a local copy of the book onto your computer by ‚Äúcloning‚Äù the forked repository.\n\nHead to the webpage of your forked repository. The URL for it should look something like: https://github.com/your-usename/r4psych\nClick on the big green button that says Code\n\n\nHere you will find a drop-down menu showing different methods of cloning the code from the remote repo.\nWe will stick with the default option of using HTTPS a.k.a. cloning by using the URL of the remote repo.\n\nClick on the copy URL button (The stacked squares icon)\nNavigate to Github Desktop and click on the first drop down menu from the left. Here you will find the Add button.\n\n\n\nClick on Add and then Clone Repository\nClick on the URL option and paste in the URL of your fork‚Äôs remote repo e.g.¬†https://github.com/your-username/r4psych\nUnder Local Path, you can choose where you want to place this cloned repo. Avoid putting your repos in Cloud services such as Dropbox or Google Drive. These can sometimes interfere with git‚Äôs ability to track your changes.\nFinally, click Clone and let git do the work! It will copy everything that is in the remote repo and bring it down locally on your computer!\nNavigate to the local path where you told git to clone to in Step 7 and check out the directories. You will learn more about these in Book Structure\n\n\n\n9.0.3.3 Make your changes\n\n\n9.0.3.4 Push your work to remote\n\n\n9.0.3.5 Create a pull request\n\n\n\n9.0.4 {renv}: Managing R packages\n\n9.0.4.1 {renv} workflow\n\n\n\n9.0.5 Book Structure\n\n9.0.5.1 Book Practices and Conventions\n\n\n\n9.0.6 Can I make a contribution without using Git?",
