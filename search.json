    "text": "Welcome!\nThis book is written in mind for someone working in Psychology and is venturing into R with little to no experience. Research data in Psychology is unique in that it is collected in formats that are human-readable but not exactly R-readable. Data wrangling conventions will often vary depending on research question and therefore by what type data is collected. In “R for Psychology”, we have compiled a series of real-world examples from different sub-disciplines and will walk through the process of wrangling, summary, analyses and visualisations\nThis book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License.\n\n\n\nHow to contribute\nThis book is built using Quarto and hosted via GitHub Pages. It is a living resource, we welcome any contributions from the Psychology community that would improve the quality of this book. There are many ways to contribute:\n\nFixing grammar and typos\nClarification or expanding on existing content\nContribute real-world data in worked examples\nAuthoring an entire chapter\n\nTake a look at our Contributing Guide to see how you can help!\n\n\nAcknowledgements\nThis book was created on the unceded territory of the Bedegal people who are the Traditional custodians of the lands where the Kensington campus is located.\nThe first version of this book was funded by the UNSW Research Infrastructure Scheme.\nWe would like to thank the following people who have contributed to the book:\n@daxkellie",

Humans have gotten out of the habit of thinking very hard about where they put things on their machine; the search capabilities on the modern computer are quite good and you can generally find files quite easily by searching for them.\nWhen you are coding in R, however, you need to explicitly tell R where to find things. You can make this process much easier for yourself by always working within an RStudio Project.\nWhen you work within an RStudio project, you can reference everything in relation to the top level of that project folder. It doesn’t matter where that project folder lives on your machine (i.e. Desktop, Documents, OneDrive, Dropbox) the code you write is always relative to your project folder. This means that you can share that whole project folder with someone else (your collaborators or supervisor), and your code won’t break.\nAlways open RStudio by double clicking on the .RProj file in the folder on your machine.

For this reason, we recommend using R Markdown documents (rather than R scripts) for your analysis.\nR Markdown is a handy file format that allows you to intersperse chunks of code with notes. This kind of document makes it easy to write explanations, interpretations, and thoughts for your future self as you code. This kind of documentation makes it much more likely to be able to make sense of what you have done and why, when you come back to your analysis in a few months time.\nR Markdown documents can also be “knitted” into html, pdf, or word documents, allowing you to share your analysis (and associated thoughts) with collaborators, even if they don’t know R.\nTo get up to speed on R Markdown and how to use it, check out RLadiesSydney #RYouWithMe MarkyMark module",

(see next)\nhaven this package is a good one for reading in .sav SPSS format files\nsjplot this package is helpful for making a ‘codebook’ of your variables and values from imported .sav files\nsurveytoolbox this package is helpful in drawing out the value labels of variables imported in .sav format – note: because surveytoolbox is on github and not CRAN, you’ll want to do the following two steps in the console. Note that we do this in the console since we only need to do it once! If the install asks you about updating packages, go ahead and do it! —(1) install the devtools package: install.packages(“devtools”) —(2) install via github: devtools::install_github(“martinctc/surveytoolbox”)\nufs this package (short for user friendly science) is a nice tool for computing the internal reliability of scales – note: one of the commands we will use in ufs requires the psych package to be installed (but doesn’t need to be loaded via library()). Ensure you install that first. Two steps: —-(1) install the `remotes`` package: install.packages(“remotes”) —-(2) install via github_lab: remotes::install_gitlab(‘r-packages/ufs’)\napa nice for making statistical output into APA style\ngt nice for making your tables look pretty\napaTables makes nice APA-styled tables of correlation, ANOVA, regression etc. output\nreport is a package to help with results reporting\npsych is an umbrella package for lots of common psych tasks\nez is a great package for stats, including analysis of variance\nemmeans is helpful for comparing specific means in a factorial design",
